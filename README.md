**SF-Sense**

*About*
-----
Instinctively you know when an area is a bit dodgy. In San Francisco, it's easy to make a wrong turn and end up in a shady part of town. SF-Sense keeps you on the right side of the tracks.

Using rolling 3 month crime data, SF-Sense will warn you when you're in a high crime area. If you feel a buzz or hear an alert, don't take out your phone, it's time to keep your wits about you.
